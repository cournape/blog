	<div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body"><p>tl;dr: <em>rant about pytest, from the point of view of a packager who had to
debug dozens of packages using pytest across multiple platforms</em>.</p>
<p>In the python world, the two most common packages used for testing in addition to
unittest(2) are nose and py.test. Both provide two fundamental functionalities:
running test (aka they provide a test runner), and a testing framework to write
tests. Some of the features provided by the framework are parameterized tests,
writing function as tests, etc... I try to avoid both libraries in general,
especially as testing frameworks, and since I have had this discussion a few
too many times at work and outside, I thought I would write why I find those
libraries problematic.</p>
<p>My first issue is related to test discovery: to make discovery "simple" to use,
both nose and py.test have fairly complex logic to detect tests. For example,
it is fairly common to write tests inside the python package (e.g. foo/tests
for package foo), but instead of simply mandating foo.tests to be a proper
package, nose and py.test will automatically look for python files even within
non packages. They also allow to write tests without having to subclass from
unittest.TestCase. To provide this feature, they rely on complicated, and in my
experience brittle logic to find tests. You may object that it should be
possible to write tests as simple functions instead of subclasses, but a
decorator to label the test functions would be much simpler (and arguablye more
idiomatic python). This point goes beyond mere esthetic: by making test
discovery implementation simple, it is harder to miss tests by accident, and
easier to manipulate them programmatically. For example, a feature I've missed
for a long time is the ability to execute tests from its name (be it a method,
class or file). It also makes testing installed packages easier.</p>
<p>Another feature of pytest is the ability to write test assertions through
python's assert statement. Besides being an abuse of assert intent, this is
often problematic because py.test needs to figure out the appropriate
unittest.assertMethod to use (often guessing wrong and causing unreadable test
failures). It makes writing test slightly easier, at the cost of harder
debugging.</p>
<p>Parameterized tests is another annoyance. Both nose and py.test offer
parameterized tests, so that you can run the same method with different
arguments, run as different tests. This is certainly useful as a feature, but
IMO both nose and py.test make that feature not that useful in practice: it is
difficult to identify which test fails, and to my knowledge impossible to run a
subset of the parameterized test.</p>
<p>Overall, those testing frameworks are fairly inflexible, and debuggins test
issues in packages using py.test especially problematic. In most cases,
straight up unittest(2) would be enough, except for parameterized tests, where
a <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue7897">proper upstream method</a> in unittest is
still waiting to happen. If you can live with its missing features, I
personally recommend <a href="https://github.com/scalative/haas">haas</a> from my friend
Simon Jagoe. One feature I especially like is the ability to run tests based on
their name.</p></div>
